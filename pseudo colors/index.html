    <p class="firstline">Hello this is my first verse of my poem</p>
    <p class="secondline">They take no shame for dark defeat</p>
    <p class="thirdline">While prizing yet each victory won,<br>The black cliffs gleam through rents in sleet </p>
    <p class="fourthline">Who fight for the Right through all retreat,</p>
    <p class="fifthline">Nor pause until their work is done.</p>
    <p class="sixthline">The Cape-of-Storms is proof to every throe;</p>
    <p class="seventhline">Vainly against that foreland beat <br>They take no shame for dark defeat</p>
